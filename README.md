# Add-Two-Numbers
Linked List

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Ex 1.
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807

Ex 2.
Input: (5 -> 7 -> 2) + (3 -> 2 -> 4)
Output: 8 -> 9 -> 6
Explanation: 275 + 465 = 698
